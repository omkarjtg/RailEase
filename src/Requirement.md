# Project Requirement Document: Simplified IRCTC Clone

## 1. **Project Overview**

### 1.1. **Objective**
To build a simplified IRCTC clone with a backend system capable of managing concurrent train reservations. The project will include core functionalities like user authentication, train search, booking, and cancellation. The goal is to deliver a functional and scalable solution with robust, thread-safe reservation management.

### 1.2. **Scope**
- **Backend System**: User authentication, train search, booking, cancellation.
- **Frontend System**: User interfaces for login, search, booking, and cancellation.
- **Deployment**: Deployment of backend and frontend systems.

## 2. **Functional Requirements**

### 2.1. **User Authentication**
- **Registration**: Users should be able to register with an email and password.
- **Login**: Users should be able to log in using their credentials.
- **Authentication**: Implement JWT-based authentication for stateless sessions.
- **Password Management**: Users should be able to reset their passwords.

### 2.2. **Train Search**
- **Search Functionality**: Users should be able to search for trains based on source, destination, date, and other relevant criteria.
- **Search Results**: Display a list of available trains with details such as train number, departure time, and available seats.

### 2.3. **Booking**
- **Reservation**: Users should be able to book tickets for available trains.
- **Seat Allocation**: Ensure that seats are allocated accurately and prevent double bookings.
- **Confirmation**: Provide booking confirmation with a unique booking ID.
- **Payment**: Implement a payment gateway for processing payments (optional based on project scope).

### 2.4. **Cancellation**
- **Cancellation**: Users should be able to cancel their bookings.
- **Refunds**: Implement refund processing if applicable.

## 3. **Non-Functional Requirements**

### 3.1. **Performance**
- **Concurrency**: The system must handle concurrent reservations and bookings efficiently.
- **Response Time**: API response times should be optimized for a seamless user experience.

### 3.2. **Scalability**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: The system should be designed to scale horizontally to handle increased load.

### 3.3. **Security**
- **Data Protection**: Ensure that user data and transactions are securely handled.
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control as needed.

### 3.4. **Reliability**
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging.
- **Backup**: Ensure regular backups of the database.

## 4. **System Architecture**

### 4.1. **Backend Architecture**
- **Technology Stack**: Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Use database transactions and locks.
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs for frontend-backend communication.

### 4.2. **Frontend Architecture**
- **Technology Stack**: React, Redux/Context API (if needed).
- **UI/UX**: Design responsive and user-friendly interfaces.

## 5. **Deployment**

### 5.1. **Backend Deployment**
- **Server**: Deploy Spring Boot application on AWS, Heroku, or similar platform.

### 5.2. **Frontend Deployment**
- **Platform**: Deploy React application on Vercel, Netlify, or similar platform.

## 6. **Project Management**

### 6.1. **Version Control**
- **System**: Git.
- **Platform**: GitHub/GitLab.

### 6.2. **Task Management**
- **Tools**: Jira/Trello.

### 6.3. **Documentation**
- **Code Documentation**: Inline comments and API documentation.
- **Project Documentation**: Setup instructions, architecture diagrams.
